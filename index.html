		<p>	An operating system is a program that controls the execution of application programs and acts as an interface between the user of a computer and the computer hardware</p>
			<p>A more common definition is that the operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer (usually called the kernel), with all else being application programs.</p>
			<p>An operating system is concerned with the allocation of resources and services, such as memory, processors, devices, and information. The operating system correspondingly includes programs to manage these resources, such as a traffic controller, a scheduler, memory management module, I/O programs, and a file system.

</p>
<ol>Functions of Operating system
		<h1>Operating system performs three functions:</h1>
		<li>	Convenience: 
		<p>An OS makes a computer more convenient to use.</p>
			<li>	Efficiency: 
		<p>An OS allows the computer system resources to be used in an efficient manner.</p>
		<li>	Ability to Evolve: 
		<p>An OS should be constructed in such a way as to permit the effective development, testing and introduction of new system functions at the same time without interfering with service</p>
		</li>

		<h1>The Operating system must support the following tasks. The task are:</h1>
		<li>	Provides the facilities to create, modification of programs and data files using an editor.</li>
		<li>	Access to the compiler for translating the user program from high level language to machine language.</li>
	<li>	Provide a loader program to move the compiled program code to the computer’s memory for execution.</li>
		<li>Provide routines that handle the details of I/O programming.</li>
	</ol>

	<h1>Drivers for specific hardware devices : </h1>
	<h3>Assembler :</h3>
	<p>The input to an assembler is an assembly language program. The output is an object program plus information that enables the loader to prepare the object program for execution. At one time, the computer programmer had at his disposal a basic machine that interpreted, through hardware, certain fundamental instructions. He would program this computer by writing a series of ones and Zeros (Machine language), place them into the memory of the machine.</p>
	
	<h3>Compiler :</h3>
	<p>The High-level languages- examples are FORTRAN, COBOL, ALGOL and PL/I are processed by compilers and interpreters. A compiler is a program that accepts a source program in a “high-level language “and produces a corresponding object program. An interpreter is a program that appears to execute a source program as if it was machine language. The same name (FORTRAN, COBOL, etc.) is often used to designate both a compiler and its associated language.</p>
	<h3>
Loader :
</h3>
	<p>A Loader is a routine that loads an object program and prepares it for execution. There are various loading schemes: absolute, relocating and direct-linking. In general, the loader must load, relocate and link the object program. The loader is a program that places programs into memory and prepares them for execution. In a simple loading scheme, the assembler outputs the machine language translation of a program on a secondary device and a loader places it in the core. The loader places into memory the machine language version of the user’s program and transfers control to it. Since the loader program is much smaller than the assembler, those make more core available to the user’s program.</p>
